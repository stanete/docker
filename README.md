## Docker images with the minimum scikit-learn or tensorflow stack üê≥

The minimum stack to start playing with scikit-learn or tensorflow in a Jupyter Notebook... no fancy stuff üòÖ.

### Start playing with the images

Every image has its own Makefile with commands for building the image and running the container.

```
make build

make run
```

### You can also do it from Docker Hub

For [tensorflow](https://hub.docker.com/r/stanete/tensorflow):

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/src stanete/tensorflow
```

Or for [scikit-learn](https://hub.docker.com/r/stanete/scikit-learn):

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/src stanete/scikit-learn
```

### Disclaimer üì¢

The work will be saved in the directory where the run command is executed.
