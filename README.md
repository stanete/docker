### Keras

The minimum stack to start playing with keras and tensorflow as a backend in a Jupyter Notebook... no fancy stuff ğŸ˜…

### Mount the image and run the container

```
docker build -t keras .
docker run -p 8888:8888 keras
```

### Or from Docker Hub

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 stanete/keras
```
