## Docker images with the minimum for scikit-learn or tensorflow stack 🐳

The minimum stack to start playing with scikit-learn or tensorflow in a Jupyter Notebook... no fancy stuff 😅.

### Start playing with the images

Every image has its own Makefile with commands for building the image and running the container.

```
make build
make run
```

### Or from Docker Hub

For tensorflow:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/src stanete/tensorflow
```

Or from scikit-learn:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/src stanete/scikit-learn
```

### Disclaimer

The work will be saved in the directory where the Makefile is or where the run command is executed.
